# Introduction
This is a collection of the tools I use in my everyday life on Linux.
A couple things to note:
- I use Fedora and a minimally customized Gnome
- I use a lot of GUI tooling (like Obsidian and Zotero) that don't need customizing.
- I follow the philosophy of using the best tool for a job.

Given all that, the configuration found here are just simple ones that get my work done.
